# BTCParser

Relates sentiment of tweets about bitcoin to BTC price movements 

Twitter data gathered using taspinar's [twitterscraper](https://github.com/taspinar/twitterscraper).

[Issues with the twitterscraper have precluded accurate parsing of BTC tweets](https://github.com/taspinar/twitterscraper/issues/84). You can find the results of a "shotgun" parse I ran earlier this week [here](https://drive.google.com/open?id=1jfeG14kLj3IYW6seAAd92vRsQMSP6lZ1). Given the issue with the scraper there's no guarentee these parses aren't in some way biased, and the date range of these tweets will be all over the place. I may eventually implement twitter's native scraping API and get my data from its active feed, but for now this is what we're working with.
